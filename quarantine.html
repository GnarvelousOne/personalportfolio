     -  This project crowdsources ordinary people all over the world to help scientists
      sift through massively large data sets. I have been helping identify errors
    in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project operated by Caltech and MIT.
    From the website:<br><br><i> "The LIGO data is full of ‘glitches’,
     signals from non-astrophysical sources like small ground motions near the observatories.
      Both glitches and true gravitational wave signals appear as specific patterns
       in the images. We can correctly identify gravitational wave signals only
        if we are able to reliably distinguish them from glitches; like finding
         a needle in a haystack. The research team cannot identify all the
          glitches on their own because: 1) There are just too many images. With
           millions of images and only a few researchers working on glitch
            identification and removal, it would take them decades to do this
             without your help. 2) Computers lack the ability to reliably identify
              patterns - the human eye is still much better at this type of task."</i><br><br>
              There's tons of different projects covering a range of topics.  But you will be
              teaching machines how to learn. So you're making a Skynet!</li><br>

            - The greatest game ever! My high score is 180,000.  If you're going
          for the gold, here's a few tips.  Try to only complete lines with a <a id=tetris1>"Tetris"</a>,
          that is, a 4-line combo.  You will go up in level and difficulty as you complete lines.
        You get more points for one <a id=tetris2>Tetris</a> than you would for 4 single lines, or even two 2-line
      combos.  You'll have to "burn off" some lesser combos but that's fine my dude, just keep
      your eye on those 4-bangers. You will score more points per level.  Save the long bars until
    you are ready for that rad <a id=tetris3>Tetris</a>.<br><br> Check out this CTCW <a id=tetris4>Tetris</a> Quarterfinal from 2019 -
  it is probably the greatest official match that has ever taken place: <a href="https://youtu.be/5sxMqLjTv6k" target="_blank">

         - I am not exaggerating when I say that this man recently saved my life.
         The book, <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Be-Here-Now-Ram-Dass/dp/0517543052/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1587564889&sr=8-1' target='_blank'><strong id='navlink'>"Be Here Now"</strong></a>, is a must read. Ram Dass is pure love.</li><br>
        <li><a class="projlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KrishnaDasMusic" target="_blank">Krishna Das</a>
            - A friend and contemporary of Ram Dass, this man is one of the greatest kirtan
          performers I have found. I recommend starting with the live 15 minute version
        of "Om Namah Shivaya" performed at St. Andrew's in New York. He is currently
      posting a weekly online satsang from his apartment.</li><br>

         - Over 400 of my favorite songs. Maybe you've grown tired of what you've
          been listening to, here you can find some new stuff.  Not me, I really don't like most
        new stuff I hear. Mostly old stuff.  So this is a lot of old stuff which could be new stuff.</li><br>
